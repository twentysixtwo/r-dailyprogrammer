/* 
Challenge #122 [Intermediate] User-Space Threading

Implement efficient and dynamic user-level threading library

efficient - switching thread of execution must be done as quickly as possible
dynamic - provide a way to allow end-users to change how fast you switch and what kind of algorithm you use for timing

//ThreadID createThread(void (threadFunction)(void)) 
//bool destroyThread( ThreadID givenThreadID)
